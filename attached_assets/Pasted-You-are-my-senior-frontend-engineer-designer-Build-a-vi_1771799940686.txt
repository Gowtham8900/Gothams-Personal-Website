You are my senior frontend engineer + designer. Build a visually stunning, futuristic personal website for me (single person portfolio) with lots of tasteful motion (NO videos). Everything should feel premium: hover states, smooth transitions, animated gradients, parallax, subtle 3D/particle background, and micro-interactions.

GOAL
- A futuristic, highly interactive personal site about me + my projects.
- Fast, clean, accessible, mobile-first, SEO friendly.
- Deployed free on Vercel.
- No heavy assets. No video. Prefer CSS + lightweight canvas for background motion.

STACK (use exactly this)
- Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion for animations
- react-icons (or lucide-react) for icons
- next-sitemap for sitemap
- next-seo (optional) or manual metadata in Next App Router
- (Optional but preferred) @react-three/fiber + drei OR a lightweight Canvas particles implementation for a subtle animated background.
  - If three.js is used: keep it minimal (one scene background, low-poly geometry, low GPU load, respects prefers-reduced-motion).
  - If not: implement particles with canvas 2D.

DESIGN LANGUAGE (very important)
- Futuristic / cyber-clean / “premium SaaS landing”
- Dark mode by default, with neon accents (electric blue / purple / teal). Use gradients, glassmorphism cards, subtle noise texture.
- Layout: lots of whitespace, large headings, crisp typography, grid-based.
- Everything interactive: cards lift on hover, buttons glow, links underline-animate, sections fade/slide in on scroll.
- Add a global animated background (particles / gradient waves / subtle 3D blob) that moves slowly.
- No stock photos needed. Use abstract UI shapes + gradients + animated lines.

SITE STRUCTURE (pages)
1) Home (/)
   - Hero: my name, role tagline, short intro, primary CTA buttons (View Projects, Contact).
   - Animated “tech orbit” badges (React, .NET, Azure, etc.) that float subtly.
   - Highlight stats (Years experience, repos/projects, specialties) with count-up animation.
   - Featured Projects (3 cards)
   - Timeline preview
   - Call to action footer

2) Projects (/projects)
   - Filterable projects grid (All / Work / Side Projects / OSS)
   - Each project card: title, short impact line, tags, “Case study” link
   - On hover: animated border glow + tilt effect
   - Clicking opens a dynamic route case study page (/projects/[slug])

3) Project case study page (/projects/[slug])
   - Hero with project title, role, stack, outcomes
   - Sections: Problem → Approach → Architecture → Results → Lessons
   - Include a “system diagram” component (simple SVG lines + nodes, animated draw-in)
   - Include “metrics” component with animated bars
   - Back link + next/prev project

4) About (/about)
   - Short story, strengths, what I’m focused on
   - Skills grid with animated progress / category chips
   - Timeline (work + key milestones) with scroll reveal
   - “Now” section (what I’m doing currently)

5) Contact (/contact)
   - Minimal form (name/email/message) with client-side validation
   - Use a “mailto:” submit by default (no backend), but build it clean so I can add an API route later
   - Social links

CORE COMPONENTS
- Sticky top navbar (blur/glass) with active route indicator + subtle animated underline
- Theme toggle (optional; default dark)
- Animated background component (particles or 3D blob)
- Section wrapper with scroll reveal (Framer Motion + Intersection Observer)
- Reusable Card component with hover glow + tilt
- Button component (primary neon glow + secondary ghost)
- Tag/Chip component with animated gradient border
- Footer with links + “built with Next.js” small text

ANIMATIONS / INTERACTIONS (must include)
- Page transitions (App Router): animate route change (fade + slight slide)
- Scroll reveal for sections (stagger children)
- Hover tilt cards (small rotation based on mouse position)
- Animated gradient borders on cards (subtle)
- Parallax effect in hero background (mouse move)
- Reduced motion support: if prefers-reduced-motion, disable heavy motion + reduce particles

CONTENT (use placeholders but structured)
- Use my name as “Gowtham” (I will edit later)
- Role tagline: “Software Engineer • .NET • React • Azure”
- Projects: create 6 sample projects with realistic descriptions and tags:
  - Boom / Inventory Integration (Work)
  - Application Rules Engine & Fees (Work)
  - Lease Document Generation Pipeline (Work)
  - OpenRadius.ai (Side)
  - RentMate (Side)
  - Observability + OTel Dashboards (Work)
- Include tags like: Next.js, React, .NET, Azure Functions, Service Bus, OpenTelemetry, EF Core, TypeScript.

ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS
- Must be performant (Lighthouse-friendly)
- Use Next Image only if needed (mostly avoid images)
- Use semantic HTML, accessible focus states, keyboard navigable
- SEO:
  - Add metadata per page
  - Add OpenGraph defaults
  - Create sitemap.xml + robots.txt (next-sitemap)
- Add a JSON-LD Person schema on Home or About page
- Add smooth scrolling and anchor links for sections on Home
- Add “/resume” route that downloads a placeholder PDF (I’ll replace later)
- Use environment variables ONLY if needed (none required now)

PROJECT SETUP OUTPUT
- Provide the full file/folder structure and code for each file.
- Use Tailwind with a clean config and globals (including background noise via CSS if possible).
- Add a README with:
  - local dev commands
  - deploy to Vercel steps
  - how to customize projects content
- Ensure it runs with: npm install && npm run dev

DELIVERABLE
Generate the complete Next.js project code (App Router) with the above pages, animations, and components, ready to deploy on Vercel.
